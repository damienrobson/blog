summary: Sometimes, it's OK to put something to bed

Projects are hard. Especially personal projects. It takes a great deal of
determination and sheer will-power to decide that you're going to build
something, purely because you can, and then actually sitting down for
a few evenings and doing it.

This was the case when I wrote my accessibility-focused news generator. It
was a wonderful little personal project that served it's purpose rather
well.

- I got to play with a newer version of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase (opens in a new tab)</a>, for one. I'd
worked with it previously on another project that I built for a family member, 
but that was the best part of 10 years ago; things tend not to stand still 
for that long in the software world, and Firebase has been no exception.

- I realised I'm actually OK in my ability to write GitHub workflows. It's not
something I do day in, day out, but it's nice to see that you don't always
totally lose the knowledge of how to do something, even if you don't use
it for a while.

- I don't find many of the out-of-the-box component libraries for React
to be that appealing. I'd much rather build my own stuff from scratch; yes,
it's slower, but the level of creative control I had over the appearance of
the project was much more personal. I wasn't bound to a theme or style, nor
was I bound to factor-of-X spacing/sizing and grid systems.

__I am aware of the irony that I am building my own component library, but
that's more to learn what goes on in doing such things. Also, shut up, you
don't know...__

The aggregator served a purpose. It scraped RSS feeds, collated information
for me and stuck it under a single URL that I could consume at my own pace.
In today's world, site clamour for your attention, your data and your clicks,
so it was nice to be able to build something that took a little control
back from the sites it monitored. Each article had a short synopsis attached.
If you didn't like the sound of it, you could just keep on going to the next
one without needing to change tabs, go back to search results, etc.

Unfortunately, all things have their time. The project was a little "for-me"
side venture that I enjoyed writing and putting together but, ultimately, it
served a restricted audience. It was never my aim for it to become a thing, 
and I definitely didn't plan to try and make any cold hard coin from it. This
was just something that I did to see if I could. And in the end, that's all 
that should really matter.

Things come and go. People come and go. But that doesn't mean that the impact
they have also has to leave. Yes, it can be sad or painful, but at the same
time, you can take great joy in the experiences you shared. I thoroughly
enjoyed working on my aggregator, and I take great pride in what I managed
to put out. Who knows, maybe one day I'll resurrect it and it can brighten
my day once more. 

Or, more likely, I'll let it lie, let it fade into the mists, take what I
learned from it and move onto the next thing. 

And you know what? That's OK, too.
