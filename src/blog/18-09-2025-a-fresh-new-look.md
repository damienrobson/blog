I've been doing a lot of thinking as to colours and appearances of this site over the last
few days. My favourite colour is green, so naturally I lent towards a hue of green that
was pleasing to look at and yet easy on the eye. In the end, I decided on a tint that
suited me right to the ground. And this was it:

<div class="blog-green-sample-container">
    <div class="blog-green-sample"></div>
    <span class="sr-only">
        A small, empty square, coloured Shamrock Green and with a black border.
    </span>
</div>

Lovely, isn't it. So that was that decided. Sorted. Fantastic.

And yet, still I looked. Still I played around with palettes and immersed myself
in colour theory and countless articles and generators claiming to be the best that
the internet had to offer.

And then, I stumbled upon <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better
Motherf-cking Website</a>, itself an evolution of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">
Motherf-cking Website</a>.

Immediately, my mind was changed. The sites made perfect sense. So much of the web these
days is awash in a sea of colour. A sea that not everyone can, well... <em>see</em>.
I want my blog to be as accessible to as many people as I can make it. So I took BMFW's
advice.

Everything was stripped back to basics (though not as drastically as the original
source of inspiration; I had to make a few extra padding changes, etc.). It looks bare,
but that's OK. It's barrierless. And at the end of the day, that's what the web should
be.

Open to all. Accessible to all.

Until next time.
