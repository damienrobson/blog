summary: In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity

I'm lucky enough at work to not have to worry about our flagship component
library beyond coding it; design decisions and whatnot are agreed upon
long before the work hits my desk. This is not the case when writing your
own (that's a given, really, but it feels like it needed to be said out
loud...).

I've always had an interest in how things _look_. I find colour theory to
be a fascinating subject that I wish I had the time to immerse myself in,
not that it would have much use if I did. If I take photos, and that's a
big if, I don't take photos of people, and I certainly don't do "staged"
photos where everyone is posing for the shot. I find photos a lot more
enjoyable when they're totally natural, unfiltered snapshots of that
fleeting moment in time.

It's the same with user interfaces. Ugly interfaces tend to be unusable.
Things are never clear or obvious. Colours often get in the way of one
another. Key elements get lost in the noise and finding out where you
are in the first place is challenge enough. I recently had the pleasure
of hosting my first "anti-huddle" at work, an idea coined (at least, to
the best of my knowledge) by the wonderful Hannah Cox. The idea here is
to gather together a bunch of people who have an interest in accessibility,
to whatever degree suits them, and critique an established website. As
a lifelong Sunderland AFC fan, it was painful to lead a discussion as to
why the club's official sites weren't up to scratch (home page has at
time of writing 133 issues).

At the same time, examining existing sites and seeing where they've gone/
been led astray can add fuel to the fire. Building my own UI library, purely
as a hobby project, gives me the chance to try and right some of the wrongs
I see out on the web on a daily basis. But my God is it difficult. Never
has my knowledge of something been put to such a test (at least, not since
the last time I worked on my hobbyist game dev projects). I find myself
chasing pixels, studying shades of colour I didn't know existed and
chamfering border radii because it still doesn't look spot-on.

In this day and age, nobody wants a plain old `<button>` element. That's
just the world in which we live. But have you ever sat down with said
element and tried to take it beyond it's humble default state and
make it something more, whilst at the same time retaining all that
makes it what it is in the first place? Well, I have, and it takes
so much more focus that I have, and so much more persistance to boot.

Despite all of that, I'm chipping away at my list of "core" features
that I'd like ClarityUI to have before I announce it as something
that someone could actually use. My implementation of `<button>` is
completed, at least as a first pass, and I've moved on to that other
UI library stalwart: the `<input>` element.

I expect that my next post will be a cavalcade of reason why inputs
are awful and why I now officially hate them, but I'll leave that for
another time. For now, I'm off to write more CSS variables and class
names; I'll leave you with a tried-and-tested phrase from the late,
great, Ken Dodd (I saw him perform live once. Yes, his shows really
did end in the daylight...).

Tatty-bye!
