Component libraries are fun. They're a great way of achieving a consistent
appearance with minimal effort. It all boils down to finding one that you
like, installing it and off you go. Simple!

Well, as part of my ongoing efforts to increase my portfolio of work,
embelish my CV a little and maybe even learn something along the way, I've
started writing my own component UI library: say hello, to
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@damienrobson/clarityui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ClarityUI (opens in a new window)</a>!

It's new. It's shiny. And it has a whole 1 components! Yes, it's very much
a WIP but I'm in no rush to get it done. As I said, I'm using it all as a
learning experience to keep up with things that I don't normally get to play
with in my day-to-day work.

So far, I've learned that Vite's config can become incredibly complex and
varied, and it doesn't take a lot to get there. Part of the fun of doing
something like this is getting to work with tools that I take for granted
professionally; working for such a big company, a lot of things fall beyond
my jurisdiction. But here, everything is down to me, and it's important that
I understand what the heck everything does, what purpose it serves and why
that particular approach is the best compared to any others.

Naturally, building something like this allows me to flex my accessibility
muscles. Most, if not all, UI libraries are accessible to some degree, but
it always feels like an after-thought, something bolted onto the end of
the development life-cycle as a box-ticking exercise. I want to flip that
on it's head. I've started out with one of the most common elements on the
web today: the humble button.

Now, buttons by their nature tend to lend themselves to accessibility quite
nicely in their purest form. They're pretty self-descriptive. They tend to
describe their purpose very well. A semantic button would more-often than
not suffice in most situations.

So why am I adding yet another one to the pile? Well, firstly, because I
can. But secondly, I want the things that I build to be appealing to the
eye and not attached to a particular colour scheme or styling. Yes, things
should be consistent, but at the end of the day functionality should always
come before the eye-candy, or at the very least tied with it. There's no
use in building a visually-stunning button if it doesn't work like a button;
heck, there are buttons out there that you would look at and think, "that's
not a button". Which is bad.

I'll leave it there for now but I'll try and keep updates on progress coming
as I get around to them. Watch the horizon.

Grazie mille!
