summary: Sometimes, all it takes is a spark of inspiration

In today's world of social media, the humble blog can feel a little...
dated. People have to actually go find it and read it of their own
volition. Updates aren't automatically fed into streams of news.

But there are advantages to building and maintaining your own part
of the web.

1. I can style it as I want;
2. I can say what I want (within reason, of course);
3. It's a learning experience that I can take out into the world;
4. It's a resource that I can use to better myself.

My inspiration for this whole thing started when a good friend and
mentor decided the time was right to <a href="https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/everything-has-its-time" target="_blank">leave
his job</a>. I'd previously done a little bit of JavaScript tinkering
on that site, and received regular emails keeping me abreast of
Martin's upcoming posts and whatnot. Heck, I found out he was leaving
through a GitHub pull request.

What was interesting to me was that a raft of changes were made that
took the blog beyond a list of articles and into a living breathing CV,
demonstrating everything that Martin has to offer. No longer did his
blog act solely as a platform for him to communicate his ideas and
advice to the world; people could use it to get a feel for the man,
find out what he's all about, and then that in turn would help to
drive decisions to hire him for a bit of consultancy work.

I'm not actively looking for work. But I did like the idea of always
having an active CV at my disposal, even if that's not quite what it
is at the moment. It's a goal, something that I can aim for. As an added
bonus, I get to use it to keep my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills sharp.

So there you have it. The backstory, the reason for sitting myself
down one evening and pulling enough together to make a mark on the
web. Go and give Martin's website a read. I can't recommend him
enough if you're looking to work with someone to bring your digital
portfolio up-to-scratch from not only a general web perspective, but
also from an accessibility standpoint.

Maybe over the weekend, I'll write up the what and the how behind
all of this. Until then...

Arrivederci.
