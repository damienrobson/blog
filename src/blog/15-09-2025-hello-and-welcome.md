title: Hello & Welcome
---

Hi there, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I’ve been wanting to start a blog for a while, and I’m excited to finally sit down and make a start on one. This space will be where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences about software development, with a particular interest in front-end development, React and accessibility.

My hope is that this blog becomes more than just a collection of posts; I hope it can become a place to connect, learn, and maybe spark some interesting conversations.

Here’s what you can expect:

- Posts about software development;
- Insights or tips on React and accessible web development;
- Occasional reflections on general life.

Most of all, I want this blog to feel like an ongoing conversation. So if something I write resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.

Thanks for stopping by.
