Hi there, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I’ve been wanting to start a blog for a while now, and I've now found a spare moment to
sit down and start one. This space will be where I share my thoughts, ideas, and
experiences about software development, with a particular interest in front-end
development, React and accessibility.

Here’s what you can expect.

Posts about software development, I'm a professional web developer, so a lot of what I
feel I can talk about comes from there.

Insights on React and accessible web development. I work with React, and try to champion
accessibility (both digitally and in the real world) wherever and whenever I can.

Occasional reflections on general life. Life is hard. Sometimes a place to dump a load
of words can be a good thing. Or so I'm told.

Most of all, I want this blog to feel like an ongoing conversation. So if something I
write resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. You can find me on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damien-r-4b9b37371/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn (opens in a new window)</a>

Thanks for stopping by.
