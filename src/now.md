As of {{ now }}:

- work is manic;
- my wife has started the second year of her degree;
- the kids have managed to start driving me up the wall again;
- the dog is still akin to a toddler;
- blog updates continue, albeit slower owing to diminishing Netlify credits;
- I've moved my <a href="https://a11y-aggregator.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  accessibility news aggregator (opens in a new window)</a> into a maintenance state (at least for now); and
- work continues on <a href="www.npmjs.com/package/@damienrobson/clarityui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my accessibility-focused React component library (opens in a new window)</a>;
