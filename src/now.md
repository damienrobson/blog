As of {{ now }}:

- work is not settling down despite the fact that we creep ever-closer to Christmas;
- blog updates continue, but writing is hard;
- I've turned my <a href="https://a11y-aggregator.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  accessibility news aggregator (opens in a new window)</a> off as even I'd stopped using it; and
- work has stalled on <a href="www.npmjs.com/package/@damienrobson/clarityui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my accessibility-focused React component library (opens in a new window)</a>, as time keeps getting away from me.

<h2>Current Activities</h2>

- Currently reading: Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring);
- Currently watching: Fallout (ahead of the new series);
- Currently playing:
  - Hollow Knight (again);
  - Spider-Man Remastered;
  - Coral Island;
  - Final Fantasy X (again); and
  - SackBoy: A Big Adventure (because I have a single trophy left to get).
