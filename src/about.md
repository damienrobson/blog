Hi. I'm Damien, though I only ever get called that if I'm in trouble; most
people call me Damo (for clarity, Day-mo, not Dah-mo) and I'm happy to let
them do it. I'm a husband, a father of three. We also have a Lurcher-cross
named Ted, but no-one is quite sure what he's been crossed with...

I'm from a large city in the North-East of England (but not the one you're
more likely to be thinking of). I've been a professional software developer
for around 15 years; originally I worked with C# and other .NET offerings,
but have worked more on the web side of things for the last 10 years;

During my career, I've worked on a wide variety of projects; everything
from a humble point-of-sale app driven by cloud technologies to off-air
service monitoring systems for television broadcasting networks, and
all points in-between. I'm always looking to try my hand at something
new if the opportunity presents itself.

I currently work at one of the largest global tech companies in the UK as
a front-end developer. When I first joined, I took on more of a full-stack
role; now I work purely in the world of front-end component libraries
(namely, the open-source, in-house one). This is also the place that gave
rise to my fascination with digital accessibility, and led me to becoming
an Accessibility Champion. I've had the honour and pleasure of working with
some amazing people over the 6 years I've been there, and I'd like to think
that I've built some friendships for life because of it.
