Here's a list of things I'm currently up to:

- this blog;
- my (now-discontinued) accessibility news aggregator;
- building my own <a href="www.npmjs.com/package/@damienrobson/clarityui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">accessibility-focused React component library (opens in a new window)</a>;
- helping some great people get a thing off the ground (more on that soon, hopefully).

I've also got around 1,001 unfinished or yet-to-be-started projects and ideas
bouncing around in my head; if any of them take root and begin to blossom,
I'll be sure to update the list above.

My door is also open if you want a second pair of eyes on something, or
feel something I've written about is relevant to something you're working
on right now; if that's the case, feel
free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damien-r-4b9b37371/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn (opens in a new window)</a>
or on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/damienrobson.bsky.social/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BlueSky (opens in a new window)</a>
and we'll see what we can make happen!
