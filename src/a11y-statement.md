This website endeavours to conform to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. I want every visitor to feel
welcome and find the experience rewarding. I am committed to accessibility,
and am of the firm belief that the web should be open to everyone,
regardless of technology or ability.

This site has been built using W3C-compliant code and standards, and displays
correctly in current browsers. Relying on standards-compliant HTML and CSS means
that any future browsers will also display it correctly.

Whilst I strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for
accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of
the website. Should you encounter any issues, please reach out to me immediately
and I will work to rectify the problem as soon as possible.
